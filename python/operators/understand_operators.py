Task: Understand operators
Explain: What is the difference between an operator and operand?

In programming languages, for example Python, operators and operands are the same as they are in Maths. Operators
are the symbols which explain what action needs to be performed on the objects, which are known as operands.

For example:
2 + 3
In the above example, the operator is the '+' symbol. '2' and '3' are the operands. The '+' symbol (operator), tells us
that the '2' and '3' (the operands) need to be added together.

Here is your starting code:
"""
x = 5
y = 1
"""
Add code to demonstrate that you understand how use operators to:
add
subtract
multiply
divide
find the remainder part of the division
"""
print(x+y)
print(x-y)
print(x * y)
print(x / y)
print(x % y)

"""
Add code to demonstrate that you understand how use comparison operators to:
greater than
less than
check if equal
check if not equal
greater than or equal to
less than or equal to
"""

print(x > y)
print(x < y)
print(x == y)
print(x != y)
print(x >= y)
print(x <= y)
