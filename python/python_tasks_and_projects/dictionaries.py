Task: Working with dictionaries
ðŸŽ¯ Outcome (By doing this you should): Learn how to use a dictionary

Make a dictionary called "student_1" containing the following information:
name: susan
stream: tech
completed_lessons: 4 (should be saved as an integer not a string)
completed_lesson_names: value should be list of these 3 items: "variables", "data_types", "set up"


"""

student_1 = {
    "name": "susan",
    "stream": "tech",
    "completed_lessons": 4,
    "completed_lesson_names": ["variables", "data_types", "set up", "collections"]
}

"""
Explain how a dictionary saves/structures data? Example, what does each value need to be accompanied/associated with?
    In dictionaries in Python, data is stored/saved in pairs. So, each value needs to be accompanied by a label,
    called a key. This key is used to call the value, so that Python knows where to find it. These are called key value pairs.

# Print the dictionary to the screen
print(student_1)

# Print it's data type to the screen to check it's a dictionary
print(type(student_1))

# Print the value for the key-value pair having the key "stream"
print(student_1["stream"])

# Print the value for 'completed_lesson_names' - check you can see the list of 3 items
print(student_1["completed_lesson_names"])

# Print the data type for the value for 'completed_lesson_names' - check it is a list
print(type(student_1["completed_lesson_names"]))

# Print the first element/item in the list of 'completed_lesson_names' (should output "variables")
print(student_1["completed_lesson_names"][0])

# Change the value of "completed_lessons" to 3 (an integer not string). Make sure you change was successful by
# printing your dictionary to the screen again.

# Delete "data_types" from the list under the key 'completed_lesson_names'

# Use the keys() method on your dictionary to list all the keys
