"""
Task: Understand datatypes: int, float, boolean
ðŸŽ¯ Outcome (By doing this you should): Learn how to use some commonly used data types

Explain and demonstrate: Numeric data types: int and float
An integer is a whole number, with no decimal point or value.

For example:
"""
x = 5
print(type(x))

"""
A float data type is an integer with a decimal point and decimal value.

For example:
"""
y = 5.876
print(type(y))

"""
Explain and demonstrate: Boolean data type
A boolean data type is used to demonstrate whether something is true or not. It will look at the data given and 
decide, based on criteria given by the user, whether it is true or not.

For example:
"""
print(x >= y)
print(x != y)
"""
Explain why the result is not 0.9999999... with this code and what lesson we should learn:
"""
One_third = 1 / 3

print(One_third)

# Python should show 0.3333333333333333
print(One_third * 3)
# python rounds it to 1.0
