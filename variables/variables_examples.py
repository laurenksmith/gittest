Task: Python variable basics

* In your Python learning project, create a folder called 'variables', then create a new file called
'variables_examples.py' for the following tasks
* Set/assign a variable
* Try to set a variable with a number value
* Try to set a variable with a decimal value
* Try to set a variable with a string value
* How is using '==' different?
* Print the values and data types of the variables you set values for above
* What does it mean that Python is...
    * A strongly typed language? Compare to a weakly typed language. Include a code example
    * A dynamically typed language? Compare to a statically typed language. Include a code example
* Overwrite the value of one of your variables which stores a number
* Check the id() of the variable before and after you overwrite the variable with a new number
* Why does the 'id' of the variable change?
* Assign one variable to another
* Start with this code: python x = 10 y = x * Check the id of x and y
* Explain why the id of x and y are the same
* What happens if after assigning x = y, I give x a different value? Does the id of y change also?
* Ask the user for some input and print the input to the screen
* Get the user's name and print to the screen
* Improve previous code to: Get name, age and DOB details from a user and print the details to the screen
* If time, improve previous code to:
    * Prompt the user and get the input on the same line
    * Print "Hi <name>" on the one line
